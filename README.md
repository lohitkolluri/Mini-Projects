# Mini Projects Archive

This repository contains a collection of mini projects implemented using different programming languages and serves as a demonstration of various concepts and skills.

## Projects:

 1. Calculator
 - The Calculator project is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

 2. Bus Ticket Reservation System
 - This is bus reservation system implemented in C. It allows users to view a list of buses, book tickets, cancel bookings, and check the status of buses. The code uses file handling to store and retrieve passenger details and seat availability.

 3. CCValidator Using Luhn's Algorithm
-  This program uses the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers. It prompts the user to enter a credit card number and checks whether it is valid or not based on the Luhn algorithm. If the entered number is valid, it prints "Valid!" to the console; otherwise, it prints "Invalid!". The program continues to prompt for input until the user enters "exit" to quit.

4. Student Mini Project Management System
- It is a program designed to assist faculty in managing students' mini projects. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding projects, viewing project details, and editing project marks. The program uses a class called "Project" to store information about each project, including roll number, name, and marks. It provides a menu-based interface for easy navigation and interaction with the system.
